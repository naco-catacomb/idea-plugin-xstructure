= xStructure doesn't resolve my XML file ! =

   * check your file is associated to a DTD or XSD
   * check there is no error in IntellijIDEA log file, mapping definition file may be invalid (next releases will improve errors reporting) 
   * check there's a mapping definition file supporting your model
      * get *Mapping definition directory* value from _General Settings_
      * look for a file whose `supported-schemas` tag contains your model URI
      * check file name ends with `.xml`

= May I associate mappings to a XML file without model declaration ? =

Not in the 1.0 version. Note this feature is planned, using file path matching.

= What's about XPath implementation ? =
All default mappings are defines using _default_ implementation. XPath implementation is slower since resolution context includes the whole file, whereas the _default_ implementation is based on current node context.

However, XPath works and provides more flexibility to build label or tooltip. I'll see how I can improve this implementation type.
